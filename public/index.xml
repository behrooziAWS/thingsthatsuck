      <title>A Future Talk</title>
      <link>https://example.com/talks/a-future-talk/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Story&amp;rsquo;s talks pages can highlight upcoming appearances, promoting your talks
before you present. This is a dummy page illustrating this capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll have to add &lt;code&gt;buildFuture: true&lt;/code&gt; to your site&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;config.yaml&lt;/code&gt; to enable
this setting.  Talks pages that are in the future won&amp;rsquo;t appear on the homepage
or in your RSS feeds; they&amp;rsquo;ll only appear in the &lt;code&gt;/talks/&lt;/code&gt; list page of your
site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For example, people who blog about their presentations on software engineering.
It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to share your writing and speaking with the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

more details. There&amp;rsquo;s also a listing of features that either don&amp;rsquo;t need
a separate documentation page, or just don&amp;rsquo;t have full documentation yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
