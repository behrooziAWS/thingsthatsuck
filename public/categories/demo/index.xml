      <description>&lt;p&gt;Story is a beautiful responsive Hugo blog theme with many extra features including presentations, math typesetting, and search.
It is targeted to technical writers and speakers: people such as software engineers and open source developers, who want a website for their technical work.
For example, people who blog about their presentations on software engineering.
It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to share your writing and speaking with the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Story has a lot of features, but most are optional and have smart defaults!
This page is an introduction to Story, with links to further pages that go into
more details. There&amp;rsquo;s also a listing of features that either don&amp;rsquo;t need
a separate documentation page, or just don&amp;rsquo;t have full documentation yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Feature flags, which are called &lt;em&gt;classes&lt;/em&gt; in the markup, control many of Story&amp;rsquo;s features.
You can enable and disable them in your site config, or in an individual post&amp;rsquo;s front matter.
This article documents Story&amp;rsquo;s feature flags.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

piece of content. Or you can set a global default and override it on individual
pieces of content.
Scroll to the bottom of any page on this site to see how author profiles are

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article is a demo of Story&amp;rsquo;s image-related features (other than &lt;a href=&#34;https://example.com/figures&#34;&gt;figure captions&lt;/a&gt;).
Story can apply a variety of stylistic and layout transformations to your images.
These features are enabled by unobtrusive, accessibility-friendly tricks that give you more control over images than Markdown typically provides.
Story also has out-of-the-box support for header and preview images, for a visually stunning site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This page first explains how search setup works, and then provides copy-paste
ready code samples for you to use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
